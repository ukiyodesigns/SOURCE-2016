    <p>Every two weeks for the past two years, my SOURCE team and I made our way down to the LA County Fairgrounds for our client meeting with the Career and Technical Education Center. CTEC, a program of The Learning Centers at Fairplex, provides year-round educational programs for high school students in a variety of vocational skills that prepare them for real world careers and professional success. Each year CTEC touches hundreds of students’ lives in their classrooms, but as I’ve learned in my time at SOURCE, their impact stretches far beyond the walls of The Learning Centers. </p>
    <p>A guiding tenet of CTEC’s mission is to equip its students to make a positive difference in their communities. They certainly meet this goal through their core programs. In 2014, the SOURCE team conducted a program impact analysis, and my team was able to visit classes and distribute surveys to students. From automotive to hospitality, each vocational track was taught by a passionate teacher to excited and open students. As they learned various technical aspects of their trade, students were also clearly imbued with the importance of teamwork, generosity, and respect.</p>
    <p>CTEC’s focus on the student does not stop with their educational programs. In SOURCE’s work with CTEC, we got to know Andre Rishi, who oversees their Career Services Center. Andre is not only phenomenal at his job, but also truly cares about his students’ outcomes. Through our SOURCE-CTEC partnership, we created a Financial Literacy Handbook, a Career Services Handbook, and a College Scholarship Brochure. Andre uses these materials in his work with all CTEC students to supplement the skills they’re learning in the classroom. Furthermore, CTEC is able to sell these materials to local school districts. My old Lead Consultant and current co-manager Vanessa Liu was able to see our Career Services handbook in action at Garey High School, where senior students taught the content of our handbook to freshman; seniors could develop leadership skills, while freshmen learned how to be career-ready.

    <p>CTEC’s Director of Education, Margie Shamblin, and Education Manager, Inri Constancio, work beyond their core duties to run the Junior Fair Board scholarship program. The JFB is a two-year leadership development program for high-achieving juniors and seniors, and is also accompanied with a $2,000 college scholarship. This past year, SOURCE worked with CTEC and the JFB to develop a concrete and outcomes-driven curriculum. Through this process, the SOURCE team was able to meet the 34 students that participated in JFB this year. To me, these students were an embodiment of all that CTEC accomplishes. They were kind, passionate, and excited about their futures and making a positive change in their communities. </p>
    <p>The biggest lesson I learned working with CTEC is to never settle - always strive to make your impact larger than what you set out to accomplish. I feel so lucky to have worked with a nonprofit that serves as a hub for youth learning and empowerment in our community.</p>
