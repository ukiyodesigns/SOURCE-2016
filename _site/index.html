                            <h3>Fostering Collaboration</h3>
                            <p>This year we focused heavily on the need for collaboration among nonprofits identified in the Spring of 2015 during the SOURCE Summit. <strong>Our local community’s desire for greater collaboration was addressed through our continuation and improvement of Nonprofit Brown Bags</strong>. In addition to preserving a common space for nonprofit staff and community leaders to connect and share ideas, <strong>we introduced an educational component to our Brown Bags called the SOURCE Speaker Series</strong>. The Speaker Series invited a diverse range of outside experts to speak at each luncheon on a number of topics essential to running a successful nonprofit. We found that the speakers encouraged more robust discussions and greater collaborative efforts. <strong>Our most notable Brown Bag of the year saw an attendance of over 40 community members</strong>, who sat with representatives from the Ralph M. Parsons, Weingart, and Rose Hills Foundations and engaged in tailored discussions about how to write grants more effectively.</p>
                            <h3>Leveraging Mentorship</h3>
                            <p><strong>This year also saw a renewed effort to expand our network of mentors and supporters, particularly through our Mentorship Program</strong>. Our programming has brought speakers ranging from CMC alum Paul Schulz, Vice President of Development and Donor Relations at California Community Foundation and former CEO of the Red Cross, to Sarah Twombly from Blue State Digital. All of our speakers provided beneficial insights on how our consultants could create more productive and collaborative partnerships with our clients.</p>

                        <div class="col-sm-6">
                            <h3>Creating Impact</h3>
                            <p>Our teams created lasting impact in the community through their partnerships with SOURCE’s seven clients. For example, our team working with Foothill Family Shelter developed and implemented marketing strategies for their thrift shop that turned the business profitable. <strong>In total, our SOURCE students spent over 3000 hours supporting and growing local community and nonprofit partners</strong>. Our work with Client partnerships engaged over 18 community leaders directly, who valued our team’s work at over <strong>$30,000</strong>. The nonprofits that we worked with in the 2015-2016 year touched the lives of over <strong>12,000 individuals</strong> in Claremont and across the nation. Beyond our traditional partnership model, we also hosted a record-high number of IdeaJams, brainstorming with <strong>6 local nonprofits</strong> on opportunities ranging from engaging membership to digitalizing organizational processes. <strong>Through our broader engagement efforts, including our IdeaJams and Nonprofit Brown Bags, we connected with over 40 local organizations and 100 nonprofit leaders and members in Claremont.</strong></p>
                            <p>We concluded this year’s client relationships by hosting our first ever year-end <strong>SOURCE Symposium</strong> to showcase the incredible work of our 34 SOURCE consultants and the solutions created within our seven nonprofit partnerships, as well as celebrate our partners and supporters. We are infinitely appreciative of all of you who have helped make SOURCE what it is today. We look forward to another year of continued engagement with the Claremont community.</p>

                        <p>“Are you sure?” I asked that question around fifty times after I found out that I had been accepted into SOURCE’s Associate Consultant class. Don’t get me wrong—I was extremely excited to work for SOURCE. I chose Claremont McKenna College largely because of SOURCE and I could not believe that I would actually be a part of the organization. My previous nonprofit work had always made me feel fulfilled and connected, unparalleled feelings that led me to apply to colleges with strong civic engagement and nonprofit collaboration programs. It was a dream come true.</p>

                        <p>Pacific Lifeline is much more than a homeless shelter. After spending the fall semester off-campus, I entered our client relationship halfway through the year . This transition initially appeared challenging, but Pacific Lifeline’s mission, history, and energy made the process seamless. In the end, through our year-long partnership, our team was able to help Pacific Lifeline increase the efficiency of its mission through our work on strategically planning, board development, and web development.</p>

                        <p>This year, SOURCE hosted its second annual, year-end Symposium to showcase and celebrate our impact in the community. The Symposium took place the afternoon of Friday, April 28th at Claremont Mckenna College’s Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum. Considering feedback from last year’s event, Lisa Hao ‘20 preserved the presentation aspect of the event, but incorporated it into a more interactive environment to showcase our work. Thus, each of the seven SOURCE teams set-up individual tables where they displayed their deliverables from the year, and were able to converse with the attendees.</p>

                                <p>SOURCE provides value-added services for our nonprofit Clients at no cost to them. For example, this year we invested 540 hours in the Pacific Lifeline team’s work. These services would have costed $14,985 at the going rate for an undergraduate consultant intern.</p>
                                
                                <h2 class="financial-h2" style="color:#315a69">Student Development - $3,810</h2>
                                <p>SOURCE is committed to student development. In addition to hosting monthly workshops targeted to develop our new hire Associate Consultants, SOURCE hosted over 5 general workshops for the 2016-2017 year. In September, we brought in Janet McIntyre from Executive Service Corps to discuss best practices in nonprofit consulting and board development. Many of our consultants were working on board development and applied the workshop’s teachings to create more tailored and personalized solutions for our clients.</p>
                                
                                <h2 class="financial-h2" style="color:#2180ba">Culture - $1,340</h2>
                                <p>A tight-knit and cohesive culture is key to SOURCE’s success. In order to create a familial and supportive environment at SOURCE, we hosted day-long retreats and coordinated social events where our Consultants could build deeper relationships. One of the most memorable events of this year was our new hire bonding night, in which our new Associate Consultants worked together to make pizzas from scratch.</p>
                                
                                <h2 class="financial-h2" style="color:#54c0e9">Internal Projects - $1,500</h2>
                                <p>This year, projects ranged from planning and executing our Nonprofit Lunch and Learns, developing donor relations, and expanding our online resources for nonprofits. With the continued passion and energy of our students, SOURCE continues to innovate and progress in order to bring lasting impact to the Claremont community.</p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 mobile-margin-b margin-b-100">
    <p>“Are you sure?” I asked that question around fifty times after I found out that I had been accepted into SOURCE’s Associate Consultant class. Don’t get me wrong—I was extremely excited to work for SOURCE. I chose Claremont McKenna College largely because of SOURCE and I could not believe that I would actually be a part of the organization. My previous nonprofit work had always made me feel fulfilled and connected, unparalleled feelings that led me to apply to colleges with strong civic engagement and nonprofit collaboration programs. It was a dream come true.</p>

    <p>I felt like I was going to wake up any second. Or, at the very least, the SOURCE Managers and Leads would realize that they made a mistake. I had no idea why I was hired. I had no previous consulting experience and no true understanding of what consulting entailed. While I had worked with different nonprofits before, I felt like there was no reason why a nonprofit should take my advice. I already have enough trouble listening to my own advice! Why would nonprofit leaders trust a college freshman to know what’s best for their organization? I attended every meeting in constant fear that my Lead consultant would finally realize what I had always felt: that he had hired the wrong person.</p>

    <p>My insecurity severely impacted my job performance. I dreaded speaking up during meetings and hated giving feedback to my teammates. After every meeting, I would go over everything I did incorrectly and fixate on those mistakes.</p>

    <p>Although I had difficulty believing in myself, my team never stopped supporting me. My Lead offered to meet individually and helped me practice my deliverables. He made sure that I could anticipate potential questions and answer them confidently. The rest of the team helped me solidify my ideas which brought me to feel less alone in my projects. Their trust in my capability slowly encouraged me to believe in myself as well.</p>

    <p>My internal experience with SOURCE also enabled me to build confidence. Although I did not feel fully qualified to tell nonprofits how to proceed, I felt more than comfortable sharing my opinion with fellow SOURCE consultants. SOURCE’s new ad-hoc committee structure allowed me to get really involved with our internal affairs and understand the multiple initiatives. By participating in these Task Forces, I felt like I had something to contribute to the organization. I even ended up leading our Symposium Task Force and coordinated all the details for our annual event. </p>

    <p>Over time, I realized that I was concerned with the wrong issue. I kept worrying that I was not qualified enough, that I was not the person SOURCE thought I was, that I was a fluke. I spent so much energy obsessing over my own insecurities and inadequacies that I lost sight of the real reason I joined SOURCE in the first place: the nonprofits. I kept asking “Why me?” when I should have been asking “Now me, how can I help?” I had to learn to trust the hiring process or, at the very least, accept the fact that I was hired. Even if it was a mistake like I feared, I am a SOURCE consultant now. I am part of an organization where I have the unique opportunity to advise, influence and improve a real nonprofit. </p>

    <p> Through changing my focus, I spent less time fixating on my shortcomings and more time brainstorming proposals for my nonprofit. My mindset change encouraged me to be bolder and take a more active role in my team. By diverting energy away from my employment justification and towards my nonprofit work, I ironically felt more secure and validated about my position. </p>

    <p>My first year at SOURCE has been nothing like what I imagined. I am so thankful for the opportunity, the nonprofit partnership, the workshops, the mentors and even the doubts. My insecurities were what reminded me of SOURCE’s purpose: to leave a positive impact on the community.  </p>

    <p>Pacific Lifeline is much more than a homeless shelter. After spending the fall semester off-campus, I entered our client relationship halfway through the year. This transition initially appeared challenging, but Pacific Lifeline’s mission, history, and energy made the process seamless. In the end, through our year-long partnership, our team was able to help Pacific Lifeline increase the efficiency of its mission through our work on strategically planning, board development, and web development.</p>

    <p>Pacific Lifeline is a homeless shelter for women and children in the San Bernardino and Los Angeles area that empowers residents to achieve personal and social stability. Many families in the shelter are escaping domestic violence, adding even more gravity to their work. In just 2016, Pacific Lifeline’s impact reached far beyond that of a shelter:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Nine women received weekly case management, individual therapy, and group therapy sessions.</li>
        <li>Thirteen children received weekly tutoring, individual therapy, and they participated in weekly group activities.</li>
        <li>Nine women participated in bi-monthly life skill development workshops.</li>
        <li>At the end of 2016, of the nine families served that year, four moved into permanent housing and five continued to live in the shelter.</li>
        <li>76 children received back to school supplies and clothing.</li>
        <li>35 families had access to food, clothing and basic necessities, household items, Thanksgiving food and Christmas gifts, and community resource referrals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pacific Lifeline's impact is made possible thanks to the thoughtful leadership of Carmen and Kirsten, a large staff of counselors, teachers and case managers.</p>

    <p>One of Pacific Lifeline's major opportunities for growth was in board development. Pacific Lifeline had a strong board that was comprised of many longtime members from all around the country who cared deeply about the mission of the organization. Unfortunately, many of these board members did not have the capacity to perform their expected duties to their full extent. In the fall of 2016, our team created a board development manual and an onboarding presentation, following months of collaboration with Pacific Lifeline’s leadership. These assets will enable board members to understand the organization and their role before starting on the board, and also increase the efficiency of the board by clarifying, and ensuring expectations and responsibilities are met.</p>

    <p>Outside of board development, we took on three diverse projects in the spring semester: redesigning Pacific Lifeline’s website and newsletter, and creating a strategic plan. Our website and email newsletter redesigns provided Pacific Lifeline with more professional avenues to show their donors how they were using resources to make a real impact in the community.</p>

    <p>A strategic plan was then built with these new assets in mind. After interviewing key stakeholders, we performed a SWOT analysis, by examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of current practices and resources. We then split our analysis up among three pain points explicated during the interview process: fundraising, communication, and human capital. Fundraising focused on donor relations and their diversified sources of donations. Communication examined how information was shared within the organization and how those in different roles and schedules could efficiently communicate, to provide the best services and improve their pursuit of grants. Lastly, human capital emphasized an increase in, and development of Pacific Lifeline’s manpower.</p>

    <p>The results of our deliverables are already seen at PLL:</p>
    <blockquote>We’ve already used the deliverables in grant proposals and in our recent board meeting. We will be starting to work on the action items; it breaks down tasks that need to be addressed – making them much easier to tackle! <br><em>- Kirsten Gnubb, Pacific Lifeline</em></blockquote>

    <p>It was an honor working with Pacific Lifeline. Kirsten and Carmen were eager to work with us. SOURCE’s biggest takeaways from our relationship with Pacific Lifeline are to take advantage of pre-existing resources and networks when applicable, but to not be wary to think outside the box when bright ideas and further improve an organization. </p>

    <p>This year, SOURCE relaunched our speaker series, previously titled ‘Nonprofit Brown Bags’ as the new  ‘Nonprofit Lunch and Learn’ series. We decided to use the start of 2017 as an opportunity to rebrand and rethink the existing Nonprofit Brown Bag program.</p>
    <div class="modal-img-container">
        <img class="modal-photo" src="/assets/img/SOURCE/brownbags/NLLPhoto.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>	While the Nonprofit Brown Bag series has provided a great service to the community over the past couple of years,there was still  room for improvement. One opportunity for growth was finding a way to formalize the educational component and encourage continuous learning. In addition to developing the educational aspects, we also wanted to expand and reinvigorate community collaboration. </p>

    <p>By rebranding the program, it gave us the chance to improve these two aspects as well as establish a clear mission and set new goals that would help the program further develop. Through this process we established that the purpose of NLLs would be to connect with local nonprofits, for speakers to share ideas and inspire progress, and an opportunity for nonprofits to advance themselves and their community. </p>

    <p>After establishing this new mission, we decided to create ambitious goals to push us to make these luncheons even more beneficial to the community. The new goals of NLLs are to expose nonprofits to geographically diverse perspectives, to individualize educational workshops to local community needs, and to bring innovative perspectives and a fresh lens on traditional challenges.</p>

    <p>With these new goals in mind, we decided to bring in two speakers that used innovative ideas, tailored their ideas to community needs, made their workshops interactive and collaborative, and inspired change. The first of these speakers was Scott Sherman, Kravis Leadership Institute’s new Senior Director of Social Innovation. He gave a presentation on “How We Win: The Science of Making the World a Better Place” where he shared that the key to success was speaking the truth to others and oneself, not thinking in ‘us vs. them’, and not fighting force with force. By sharing his story and his ideas, he was able to put a new perspective on the traditional idea of “winning.”</p>

    <p>The next speaker was Gemma Bulos who is the Director of Social Innovation and Impact, also at Claremont McKenna’s Kravis Leadership Institute. In her presentation about “Impact Analysis” she shared her story about the nonprofits she started and demonstrated how other nonprofits could make the same impact she did by finding their three core services, establishing the difference between their outputs and outcomes, and mapping out their specific outcomes. </p>

    <p>Nonprofit Lunch and Learns have come a long way in the past year and this rebranding was an opportunity to focus on what we wanted to achieve through these luncheons and the find new ways to make an impact on our community.</p>

    <p>This year, SOURCE hosted its second annual, year-end Symposium to showcase and celebrate our impact in the community. The Symposium took place the afternoon of Friday, April 28th at Claremont Mckenna College’s Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum. Considering feedback from last year’s event, Lisa Hao ‘20 preserved the presentation aspect of the event, but incorporated it into a more interactive environment to showcase our work. Thus, each of the seven SOURCE teams set-up individual tables where they displayed their deliverables from the year, and were able to converse with the attendees.</p>

    <p>To kick off the Symposium, Jack Segal ‘18 and I began with a brief presentation celebrating the year and highlighting our community partners. After the presentation, the event opened up to small, informal, group sessions at the seven tables to discuss how the SOURCE consultants approached their clients’ challenges. The Symposium was attended by over 40 community leaders, professors, and students. We hope to see you at next year’s event.</p>
