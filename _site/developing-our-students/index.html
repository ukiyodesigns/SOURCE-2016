    <p>All my life I have been a hard worker. I used to think that as long I studied enough or practiced enough then I would be immune to failure. I approached every task timidly, yet diligently because I never wanted to do anything wrong. I came to Claremont Mckenna with the assumption that as long I put effort into every task I was assigned, I could not fail. SOURCE challenged this assumption.</p>
    <p>My Lead Consultant opened my first SOURCE one-on-one meeting, “Okay Lili, this meeting is going to be very relaxed, we are just going to talk about your goals for this year”. At the time, the idea of a ‘relaxed goal-setting meeting’ was an oxymoron. I had always avoided setting goals because it offered a tangible opportunity to fail. This supposedly, “short and relaxed” meeting ran for nearly an hour. Though my goals sounded something like, “I guess I should speak up more, sit up straighter and be a little more confident”, this meeting was monumental for me. It was the first time I was forced to self-identify my strengths and weaknesses in order to set tangible goals.</p>
    <p>I managed to get through my first client meeting without saying a word. After the car ride back, my Lead asked me what I thought of my first meeting. Instead of reflecting on the meeting itself, I began reading the notes I had written down during the meeting - what I had been too afraid to say in front of the client and team. My Lead responded, “Lili those are really good ideas, why didn’t you just speak up during the meeting?”.</p>
    <p>That day, I reflected on our first goal setting meeting- maybe I really did lack self-confidence, maybe I really did need to learn to share my ideas, maybe I really did need to sit up straighter. My fear of saying the wrong thing prevented me from speaking up during that meeting, but by not sharing ideas and simply putting my head down and “working hard”, I would be hurting my team. Ironically, my fear of failure would be a failure for my team.</p>
    
    <p>In just one year, SOURCE made me much more self-aware. I learned that in order to grow and to achieve my goals, I had to fail, I had to say the wrong thing sometimes, I had to have “bad ideas”. Perhaps in the real world, people would be reluctant to invest in a project pitched by a nervous, fumbling and overly apologetic college freshman. Watching my team and my client attentively listen as I would speak was self-validating. I began to see the value in what I brought to the table. More importantly, I understood that I no longer needed an environment that  would provide external validation to share my ideas. I found self-confidence.</p>
    <p>In fact, I became confident enough to take on the position of Lead Consultant next year. Last month, I had my first meeting with my new client. In that meeting, I spoke clearly, answered questions assuredly, and readily admitted when I did not know something.</p> 
    <p>During my first goal setting meeting last semester, I never thought that a year later I would be leading a meeting where I was “speaking up more, sitting up straighter and being a little more confident”. I know that leading a team of older students next year will not be easy, but I know that with hard work AND my newly found self-awareness, I will find the confidence to step up to the challenge. I hope that being a self-aware team leader will inspire confidence in next year’s newly hired consultants.</p>
